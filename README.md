  ## Description

  This application uses node js and inquirer to take in user input, then use that information to generate a README.md file for project repositories.
  ## Installation

  This application requires node js to be installed on the user system, as well as the inquirer npm package. To install inquirer, run 'npm i inquirer' in terminal while in the application directory.
  ## Usage

  Navigate to application directory, then run 'node index.js' to invoke application. Answer user prompts to provide relevant information about your project. When all prompts have been answered, a README.md file will be automatically generated and can be used for your project repository. The generated README will be located in the user-README folder.
